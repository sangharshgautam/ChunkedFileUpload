Please be aware that applicants may select to either waive the right to view their letter or recommendation, or to not waive that right.  This applicant has chosen to waive this right.  If you do not wish to accept the online LOR request for this applicant because he didn’t waive his rights to view the recommendation, please notify the applicant so that they can either change their selection or choose another recommender.   
If you would prefer to send your letter of recommendation by mail, please contact the applicant.  Some departments require the LOR electronically, so the applicant may need to select another recommender.  Please download and complete the Iowa State Letter of Recommendation Form (PDF) and send it to the graduate program to which the student has applied.  Please do not send it to the Office of Admissions. Postal and e-mail addresses for the graduate programs are available on the Program Requirements website.
You do not have to complete this form in one sitting. You may click “Save and Exit” if you would like to finish your letter at a later time.   However, once you have submitted the form, no changes can be made.  If you experience any technical difficulty, please contact us for assistance.
Thank you for your efforts on this applicant’s behalf!
